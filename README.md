Page and Extension Refresh
==========================

This Chrome extension allows you to input the [Match Patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns.html) of pages and select unpacked extensions that will be refreshed after clicking the extension icon. This is not an extension to auto refresh pages after a certain interval, and nor will that feature be added. There are many extensions in the Chrome store that have that functionality.

Note that the extension uses Match Patterns and not regular URLs. You must have the scheme (http:// or https://) and you must have a path (www.google.com/ instead of www.google.com). To select all URLs that begin with www.google.com, the URL pattern would be *://www.google.com/*.

This extension was made to speed up development of Chrome extensions. I will probably not be doing any more development on the extension itself except for bug fixes. However, I will be accepting pull requests.

This extension can be download from the Chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ichaahgapgcnefhnlmpljbjeddohppph).
